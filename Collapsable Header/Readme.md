# Parallax Effect

## What is it

Before diving into the code, it would be better to know what we are talking about.
Parallax is an optical effect or visual phenomenon where objects appear to shift their position relative to each other when viewed from different angles. 
In the context of design and user interfaces, parallax is often used to create depth and dimension by moving foreground and background elements at different speeds, 
giving a sense of motion or 3D effect.
